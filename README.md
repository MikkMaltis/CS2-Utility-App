CS2-Utility-App

  
  Main features of the application:
    **1. To give the application user the ability to select a map in the game, at the moment it is planned to have only 7 active duty maps.
    **2. Next user can choose which side they want: Counter-Terrorist or Terrorist, if needed user can go back to map page.
    3. Then you can choose different locations/callouts, if needed user can go back to maps or click the right arrow to see more locations.
    4. Next user gets greeted with different text, images & videos they can choose from for the specific locations, if user wants to go back to locations page, they      can click on left arrow.
    5. When the video starts it stops randomly on important frames, when there is some more difficult utility lineup & also there is audio behind it (me talking          about lineup).

  Technologies i use:
    I already started this project in Android Studio with Kotlin, but i could actually reconsider it & make this application with React-Native.
    At first i only plan to do it for Android, because IOS has monthly or yearly payment to even publish apps.
